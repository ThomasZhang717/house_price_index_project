\caption{{\bf The parallel coordinates plot of approaches.} This plot shows the process routes of approaches in \autoref{fig_approach_tools}. In missing values (\textbf{M}) and outliers (\textbf{O}) columns, the upper means problem is solved by model itself internally. The lower indicates that models need external help, such as multiple imputation and removing outliers identified by isolation forest.\setlength{\baselineskip}{1.25em}}
