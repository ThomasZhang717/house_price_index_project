  abstract = {Spatial autoregressive hedonic models utilize house prices lagged
	in space and time to produce local house price indices, for example,
	the spatial and temporal autoregressive (STAR) model might be used
	this way. This paper complements these models with a semiparametric
	approach, the Local Regression Model (LRM). The greater flexibility
	of the LRM may allow it to identify space�time asymmetries missed
	by other models. The LRM is fitted to 49,511 sales from 1972Q1 to
	1991Q2 in Fairfax County, Virginia. The local price indices display
	plausible and significant variations over space and time. The LRM
	price indices in selected neighborhoods are shown to differ significantly
	from those in some other neighborhoods. A new method for estimating
	standard errors addresses an overlooked problem common to all local
	price indices: how to evaluate the amount of noise in the estimates.
	Out-of-sample prediction errors demonstrate that LRM adds significant
	information to the hedonic model.}

	the availability of user friendly gam software in Splus. However,
	whilst it is flexible and efficient, the gam framework based on backfitting
	with linear smoothers presents some difficulties when it comes to
	model selection and inference. On the other hand, the mathematically
	elegant work of Wahba (Spline Models for Observational Data (1990))
	and co-workers on Generalized Spline Smoothing (GSS) provides a rigorous
	framework for model selection (SIAM J. Sci. Statist. Comput. 12 (1991)
	383) and inference with GAMs constructed from smoothing splines:
	but unfortunately these models are computationally very expensive
	with operations counts that are of cubic order in the number of data.
	A �middle way� between these approaches is to construct GAMs using
	penalized regression splines (e.g. Marx and Eilers, Comput. Statist.
	Data Anal. (1998)). In this paper, we develop this idea further and
	show how GAMs constructed using penalized regression splines can
	be used to get most of the practical benefits of GSS models, including
	well founded model selection and multi-dimensional smooth terms,
	with the ease of use and low computational cost of backfit GAMs.
	Inference with the resulting methods also requires slightly fewer
	approximations than are employed in the GAM modelling software provided
	in Splus. This paper presents the basic mathematical and numerical
	approach to GAMs implemented in the R package mgcv, and includes
	two environmental examples using the methods as implemented in the

  abstract = {Abstract Every house is different. It is important that house price indexes take account of these quality differences. Hedonic methods which express house prices as a function of a vector of characteristics (such as number of bedrooms and bathrooms, land area and location) are particularly useful for this purpose. I consider here some developments in the hedonic methodology, as it is applied in a housing context, that have occurred in the last three decades. A number of hedonic house price indexes are now available. However, it is often difficult to see how these indexes relate to each other. For this reason I attempt to impose some structure on the literature by developing a taxonomy of hedonic indexes, and then show how existing indexes fit into this taxonomy. Also discussed are some promising areas for future research in the hedonic field. In particular, greater use needs to be made of spatial econometric and nonparametric methods to exploit the increased availability of geospatial data. The main criticisms of the hedonic approach are evaluated and compared with those of the repeat-sales and stratified median methods. The overall conclusion is that the advantages of the hedonic approach outweigh its disadvantages.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study is to analyse the predictive performance of the random forest machine learning technique in comparison to commonly used hedonic models based on multiple regression for the prediction of apartment prices. A data set that includes 7407 records of apartment transactions referring to real estate sales from 2008�2013 in the city of Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, was used in order to test and compare the predictive performances of both models. Apparent challenges faced during modelling included (1) the non-linear nature of the prediction assignment task; (2) input data being based on transactions occurring over a period of great price changes in Ljubljana whereby a 28% decline was noted in six consecutive testing years; and (3) the complex urban form of the case study area. Available explanatory variables, organised as a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) ready dataset, including the structural and age characteristics of the apartments as well as environmental and neighbourhood information were considered in the modelling procedure. All performance measures (R2 values, sales ratios, mean average percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of dispersion (COD)) revealed significantly better results for predictions obtained by the random forest method, which confirms the prospective of this machine learning technique on apartment price prediction.},

  abstract = {This paper offers a theoretical explanation for the stylized fact that forecast combinations with estimated optimal weights often perform poorly in applications. The properties of the forecast combination are typically derived under the assumption that the weights are fixed, while in practice they need to be estimated. If the fact that the weights are random rather than fixed is taken into account during the optimality derivation, then the forecast combination will be biased (even when the original forecasts are unbiased), and its variance will be larger than in the fixed-weight case. In particular, there is no guarantee that the �optimal� forecast combination will be better than the equal-weight case, or even improve on the original forecasts. We provide the underlying theory, some special cases, and a numerical illustration.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a non-parametric method for estimating spatial price functions. Space is divided into squares. The independent variables are barycentric coordinates that uniquely describe the location of observations in space. The regression coefficients are estimates of the height of the function directly over the vertices of the square spatial units. Within each square the function has hyperbolic iso-price curves and parabolic sections. The price function is continuous, but not differentiable, at the boundaries between contiguous squares. This method is applied to the problem of describing the price per front foot of land in the Chicago CBD. A rather complex price surface is revealed that would be difficult to estimate using other methodologies but was easily estimated by this simple method.},

  abstract  = {Accurate weather data is important for improving agricultural productivity in developing
countries. Unfortunately, weather sensors can fail for a wide variety of reasons.
One approach to detecting failed sensors is to identify statistical anomalies in the
joint distribution of sensor readings. This powerful method can break down if some
of the sensor readings are missing. This paper evaluates five strategies for handling
missing values in anomaly detection: (a) mean imputation, (b) MAP imputation, (c)
reduction (reduced-dimension anomaly detectors via feature bagging), (d) marginalization
(for density estimators only), and (e) proportional distribution (for tree-based methods
only). Our analysis suggests that MAP imputation and proportional distribution should
give better results than mean imputation, reduction, and marginalization. These hypotheses
are largely confirmed by experimental studies on synthetic data and on anomaly detection
benchmark data sets using the Isolation Forest (IF), LODA, and EGMM anomaly detection
algorithms. However, marginalization worked surprisingly well for EGMM, and there
are exceptions where reduction works well on some benchmark problems. We recommend
proportional distribution for IF, MAP imputation for LODA, and marginalization for
EGMM.},
